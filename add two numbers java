Code:

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	  int a = 10;
	  int b = 10;
	  System.out.print(a+b);
	  }
}


public class Main: This line declares a class named Main. In Java, every application must have at least one class with a main method, which serves as the entry point for the program.

public static void main(String[] args): This is the main method of the program. It's the starting point of execution. args is an array of strings that stores command-line arguments, but it's not utilized in this program.

int a = 10; int b = 10;: Two integer variables a and b are declared and initialized with the value 10 each.

System.out.print(a + b);: This line adds the values of a and b and prints the result to the console without a newline.
