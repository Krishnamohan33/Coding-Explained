Import Statements:

import java.util.*;: This statement imports all classes in the java.util package, which includes the Scanner class.
Class Declaration:

class Main { ... }: This is the declaration of the Main class, which contains the main method where the program execution begins.
Main Method:

public static void main(String args[]) { ... }: This is the main method, where the execution of the program starts.
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);: This line creates a new Scanner object named 'sc', which is used to read input from the console (System.in).
int n = sc.nextInt();: This line reads an integer input from the console using the nextInt() method of the Scanner class and stores it in the variable 'n'.
System.out.println(n);: This line prints the value of 'n' to the console using the println() method of the System.out object.
Input and Output:

The program prompts the user to enter an integer value through the console.
It reads the entered integer value using the Scanner object.
Then, it prints the entered integer value back to the console.
Execution:

To execute this program, compile the Java file (Main.java) using a Java compiler (javac Main.java).
Then, run the compiled class file (Main.class) using the Java interpreter (java Main).
Upon execution, the program will prompt the user to enter an integer, read the input, and print it back to the console.
